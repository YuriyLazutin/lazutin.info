      The West Coast Swing Sugar Push
      So remember that the West Coast Swing basic is walk, walk, triple step, triple step. East Coast Swing has a rock step, West Coast Swing has as walk walk.
      So, walk, walk, triple step, triple step.
      I start left, she starts right.
      The Sugar Push looks like this - walk, walk, triple step, triple step.
      So again, walk, walk, triple step, triple step.
      What's going to happen is I'm going to back up left right, she's going to come forward right left.
      I'm going to present my right hand.
      I might already have that right hand, but just in case I don't I'm going to present it.
      She's going to go walk, walk.
      On this first triple she's going to kind of slowly push into me a little bit and I'm going to absorb that weight or that energy.
      Triple, sending her back, step.
      Now I just kind of send her away from me.
      There's no need for me to take a big step towards her.
      Step, I let go of the right hand, we triple in place, triple step.
      Nicola will take her left foot and pull it behind her right as she finishes that pattern.
      So again, I go walk, walk, triple step, triple step.
      We'll do that from a different angle.
      I start left, she starts right.
      I bring her in, walk, walk.
      I take my triple kind of in place, triple, just stepping a little bit forward underneath myself, triple step.
      Then she's going to take her triple step, triple step.
      I really kind of think like behind and forward.
      So, we're going to go walk, walk, behind and forward, triple step.
      So we have a Sugar Push, like the ladies coming in to get a little bit of sugar, and then I send her away.
      That's walk, walk, triple, triple.
      That's your Sugar Push.
      We're going to do it to music.

      <li><a href=".html"> Хлыст (Whip)</a></li>
      The West Coast Swing Whip, which is our first 8-count timing in West Coast Swing.
      The whip is walk, walk, triple, walk, walk, triple.
      If we just did that in place, I go left, she goes right, walk, walk, triple step, walk, walk, triple step.
      That's basic whip timing.
      What's going to happen on the walk, walk, I bring her in.
      I go back cross.
      She comes forward and starts to pivot.
      Walk, walk, that's 1, 2.
      By 2, I have her back with my right hand.
      My left hand is in a closed position, but on 3 and 4, I'm going to take 3 and, right in place, 3 and.
      I'm 90 degrees for the lady, 4, I step across, 4.
      Now we're offset of each other.
      Her shoulders and the middle of my chest, that's 4.
      On 5, I'm going to collect my foot underneath me as she turns, 5.
      That's the whipping effect, letting go, 6, 7, and 8.
      I'm going to pick her up on 2 and let her fly on 5.
      Pick her up on 2, let her go on 5.
      I have, walk, pick her up, walk, triple step, walk, walk, triple step.
      We'll do that from a different angle.
      Again, picking up the lady on count 2, leaders, I have walk, 2, that's 1, 2, 3 and I stay right here, 3 and.
      4 moves across the slot, 4.
      As she comes forward.
      She's going to pass me, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
      On 3 and 4, Nicole is doing what's called a coaster step.
      That means back together forward.
      A coaster step is back, together, forward.
      She goes 1, 2, back, together, forward.
      She's forward on her right.
      I'm on my left.
      From here we go, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
      To music, it looks like this.
      There's your basic whip.
      
      <li><a href=".html">Техасский Томми (Texas Tommy)</a></li>
      The Texas Tommy, or whip with the hand change behind the back can happen from close position or open position. We'll go ahead start it from close position as if it's the back end of your swing out. It looks like this. One, two, three and four, five, six, seven, and eight. From here, we're going to go ahead and do reverse whip to get back to it. One, two, three and four, five, six, seven and eight. So what's going to happen here is I do the rock step and I get in front of the ladies. One, two, three and four. From here I'm going to take my left hand and I'm going to lengthen it and start to fold it behind the lady's back on the walk walk. So we go walk. Now what's going on is I'm changing hands. I'll show you from a different angle in a second. She goes walk. Now I have my right hand to her right hand, and we're going to come out of this triple step. It's going to cause the ladies to over rotate a little bit. Her next natural instinct will be to rock step. She'll rock step. From here, I'm going to reverse her back the other direction, picking her up into close. Triple step. We're in the same position we normally are. Take the walk walk. Walk, walk, triple step, rock step. So I'll do that from this angle so you can see the hand change. We go rock step, triple step. Here comes the hand change. Walk, walk, triple step, rock step, reverse her in, walk walk, walk, walk, triple step. Just so you can see it from the open position, as she comes in with a swivel swivel. Walk, walk, and I pick her up for the triple step. You can see we're in the same position as we were a second ago to go walk, walk, triple step. So whether you're doing it from close or from open, the hand change works the same. So, that's the Texas Tommy named after a Lindy Hopper named Tommy, or a whip with the hand change behind the back. We're going to go ahead and do this to music.
      
      <li><a href=".html">Отклонение партнерши (Dip A Lady)</a></li>
      To spice up your West Coast Swing a little bit, we're going to show you a turning basic with an inside turn to a dip - how to dip the ladies. So it looks like this: walk, walk, triple step, triple step, rock step, inside turn, dip the ladies, and when you're ready come out with any sort of side pass or inside turn. Now, dipping a lady. Before we even get into how to get there, let's say once we get there. She's here. My hands are going to be up like to the outside of the lady's shoulder blades underneath the shoulder, so not down here on her back. I'm up here like this. I'm going to rotate Nicola. Now Nicola is going to keep most of her weight over her right leg, and actually she bends into that right leg a little bit and kind of sits so she's supporting most of her own weight. As I bring her on to that foot, we bring her in. This is called a sit dip and it cheats just a little bit. We dip here, so she's supporting most of her own weight. As she's supporting most of her own weight, there's not real sense of fear for the ladies socially. Right? And guys, what I'm doing is just kind of lunging to my left. My weight is on my left foot. I kind of put my knee forward a little bit there. My right leg is straight. So again that goes, boom. That's a sit dip. All I have to do is bring her up to that other foot, and here we could do a side pass out or any other sort of throw out. Now if you're comfortable with your partner, you do that exact same thing, but as she goes and you lunge, she can give you her body weight. She can lay her head back, and it's probably best if she lays her head back. There's less tension in body. Then I bring her up onto that foot. Rock, step or whatever is necessary to send the ladies up. One of the things you want to notice, ladies, is as Nicola goes here, if she keeps her head up looking at me in the dip, it actually has a lot of tension. There's like neck tension there. If she relaxes her head back and pushes her belly button up, that actually gives a little bit more arch, it's more relaxed, less effort to the back. Bring her up, rock, step, triple step, triple step. How we get to that position is off of a walk or a rock step. Let's take it from a rock step. As she goes rock step, I do an inside turn, triple step. So a rock step, triple step. That's where I let go of the left, pick up the back, we'll do a sit dip and we go into the sit dip. We hang that for as long as we want, and then come out into the triple triple. So you have a sit dip where the ladies, you can choose not to give the man your body weight but still go into the dip. Or, if you trust the guy and the guy knows you pretty well, you can go into body weighted dip where her head goes back. It's better for her to think about laying back then holding her neck up which is going to create a lot of stress and tension. We're going to show you this to music. [music] And there is how we dip a lady.
